## 💼 Professional Experience

### Software Engineer – Valuemomentum Software Services  
**Dec 2020 – Jul 2023**  
- **Designed and implemented cloud-native microservices** with Java, Spring Boot & REST APIs.  
  I collaborated in an Agile team of five, defining service contracts, leveraging Spring Cloud components, and containerizing each service for Kubernetes deployment.  
- **Used Spring Security & Batch to modularize workflows** (↑25% modularity, ↑20% efficiency).  
  I architected authentication modules and batch-processing jobs that decoupled long-running imports from API layers, ensuring fail-safe retries.  
- **Improved API latency by 40%** via optimized SQL & caching layers.  
  By profiling slow queries, adding composite indexes in MySQL, and introducing Redis for hot data caching, I reduced average response times from 300 ms to 180 ms.  
- **Automated CI/CD pipelines** with Docker, Kubernetes, Azure ACR & Jenkins.  
  I authored Jenkinsfiles and Helm charts, enabling zero-downtime rolling updates across three environments (dev/test/prod).  
- **Achieved 98% unit-test coverage** using JUnit & Selenium.  
  I wrote parameterized JUnit tests for services and end-to-end Selenium scripts for critical user journeys, integrating coverage reports into the build.  
- **Managed 30+ production deployments; maintained 95% SLA adherence** (Azure Boards/Jira).  
  I led on-call rotations, triaged live incidents, and optimized alert rules—resolving 90% of issues within 30 minutes.

### Software Intern – Electronics Corporation of India  
**Mar 2019 – May 2019**  
- **Built financial transaction UIs** with Angular, Java & MySQL.  
  I developed dynamic data tables and REST clients, enabling real-time balance updates and transaction filtering.  
- **Reduced data navigation time by 40%** through unified dashboards.  
  By consolidating multiple legacy views into a single Angular SPA and utilizing server-side pagination, I streamlined user workflows.  
- **Contributed across the full SDLC**: design, development, testing & optimization.  
  I wrote technical specs, collaborated in daily stand-ups, authored unit tests, and fine-tuned database schemas for performance.

## 🎓 Academic Projects

### AI-Generated Image Detector  
**Spring 2024**  
- **Binary classifier (real vs. AI-generated) using TensorFlow + ResNet50**.  
  I customized the top layers of ResNet50, froze base layers during transfer learning, and applied image augmentations (flips, rotations) for robustness.  
- **Early stopping & data augmentation**; test metrics: 92.2% accuracy, 94.9% precision, 89.2% recall.  
  I split a 10 K-image dataset into stratified folds, monitored validation loss to prevent overfitting, and analyzed ROC curves.

### Counterfeit IC Detection System  
**Fall 2023**  
- **Modelled counterfeit-chip detection with MobileNetV2** & image-processing pipeline.  
  I preprocessed images to 224×224, normalized pixel values, and fine-tuned MobileNetV2 on a custom dataset of authentic vs. fake IC photos.  
- **Normalized all inputs to 224×224; achieved 96% training and 94.1% test accuracies.**  
  I evaluated performance with confusion matrices and classification reports, then iterated hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size).
